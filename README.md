# Reinforcement Learning in ConnectX

This repository contains implementations of various **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms for the [ConnectX](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/connectx/overview) game. These implementations showcase different approaches to training an AI agent to play efficiently.

## Implemented Algorithms
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**
- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Dynamic Rewards for RL Training**

Each implementation provides insights into the training process and strategies for decision-making in ConnectX.

Explore, experiment, and enhance these models to improve their performance in ConnectX!
